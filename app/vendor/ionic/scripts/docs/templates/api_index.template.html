# Ionic API Docs

<img class="section-header" src="/img/docs/api-intro-header.png" />


Ionic takes everything you know and loved about Ionic V1, and builds on top of it to provide a much more flexible framework.

In the API docs, you'll find two kinds of doc pages: Component and Service APIs.

The Component APIs include classes like `Checkbox`, `Toggle` or `Item` and show you how to use them, in addition to listing their selectors, available properties and events.

The Service APIs are classes like `MenuController`, `Config` or `Platform`. These are services provided by Ionic that can be injected into your classes.
